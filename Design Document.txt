Project Number: 2


1.0 Introduction
	1.1 Goals and Objectives
		The purpose of this assignment is two control the output of threads by using the two semaphore primitives: acquire and release

2.0 Data Design
	2.1 Data Structures
		Multiple array lists are distributed within the SemaphoreSystem class to act as both a production factory 
		for the producer and as a consumption base for the consumer.
		

3.0 User Interface Design
	3.1 Description of the User Interface
		The data is organized in groups within the command line. 
		You will be informed on the starting products inside of the three production shops.
		Furthermore, you will know when each customer/consumer has entered the shop and made a purchase in each round.
		Additionally, you will also be aware of when the three shops are officially closed.

4.0 Restrictions, Limitations, and Constraints
	This project is only a simulation of how threads operate within an operating system using random values. 
	Actual user data is inaccessible to this program.

5.0 Testing
	5.1 Expected Responses
		All for consumers is consumptions should be displayed within each execution. Furthermore, the shops are to be reloaded with more products by the
		producer.
		The initial products within each production shop is displayed.
	5.2 Potential Errors
		Index out of bounds error
		Thread error
